# About CS50W
CS50W is a continuation of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), diving more deeply into the design and implementaion of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience.  
> Want to learn CS50W for **free**? You can check out their OpenCourseWare [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/).
  
# Note on academic honesty
If you're taking CS50W, either through [Harvard Extension School](https://extension.harvard.edu/), [Harvard Summer School](https://summer.harvard.edu/) or [OpenCourseWare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/), please do not blindly copy paste my code. You are putting yourself at a huge risk for getting excluded from the course by the staff themselves as they grade each project thoroughly. This is a course offered by Harvard, and you will be put up to their standard.
